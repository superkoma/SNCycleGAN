# SN-CycleGAN

CycleGAN with Spectral Normalization on the discriminator weights

### Information

This project was realized for the Object Recognition and Computer Vision course that we had in M.Sc. MVA (ENS Paris-Saclay).

I worked with Matthieu Toulemont. Link of his GitHub https://github.com/MattToul

The obtained results and the details about the implemention are shown in report.pdf, in the report file.
The report was limited to 3 pages (+images).

Note that we also compared the SN-CycleGAN to another method that stabilized the training of GANs ; the WGAN-GP

Our code is based on the original CycleGAN implementation in Pytorch that you can find here https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix

## Results

Images come from the "labels→photo" generator for different methods on :

* Cityscapes dataset
